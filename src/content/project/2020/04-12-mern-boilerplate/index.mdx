## Overview

Full stack boilerplate with React, Redux, Express and MongoDB.

## Goals

Get practical experience with Redux and Express with Mongoose.

## Tech stack

- React, Redux, Redux Thunk, Passport, Formik
- Express, Mongoose

## Features

- State management with Redux and Redux Thunk
- Auth with Passport
- CRUD operations, server and client side validation

## Implementation details

It is a client side rendered React app that uses Redux for storing server state. That method was popular at the time but today is replaced with server side rendering, server components, React Query and similar. Auth is done with Passport middleware, endpoints with Express and data is stored in MongoDB with Mongoose. Babel is used for unified ES syntax across frontend and backend code.
