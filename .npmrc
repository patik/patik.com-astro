# pnpm v10+ blocks lifecycle scripts by default for security
# This project requires build scripts for:
# - jpegtran-bin: downloads the jpegtran binary for image optimization
# - sharp: downloads native binaries for image processing
#
# These were approved using `pnpm approve-builds` which created the
# necessary configuration in .pnpm/store/approved-builds.json
